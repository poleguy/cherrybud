cherrytree viewer

Working on this issue:
https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/issues/328

This currently can read simple ctd files (xml format only), e.g.

http://www.poleguy.com/simple.ctd (This link must be manually copied into the browser url bar, as it is served over http, not https, sorry.)

All it does at the moment is render the name and the tree correctly.

Please do initial alpha testing using this apk. Or wait for google, or build it yourself depending on your level of paranoia. :-)

I feel google is way too slow for approval to wait on them to do alpha testing.

immediate todo:
* open files based on extension

longer term:
* search
* allow editing
* handle detecting and auto loading changes over the network
* ctb support
